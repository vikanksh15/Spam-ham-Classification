# Project: Spam-Ham Classification

## A model that performs spam classification

### Project Description

In recent times, unwanted commercial bulk emails called spam has become a huge problem on the internet. The huge volume of spam mails flowing through the computer networks have destructive effects on the memory space of email servers, communication bandwidth, CPU power and user time. To overcome this problem we have made a Spam-Ham classification model using Naive Bayes Classifier.

## 📚 Dataset
You can find the dataset used for the project [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/).

We Executed these 7 Steps, one after the other, to implement our spam classifier:

Step 1: Load the data

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step 4: Data Visualization

Step 5: Splitting into train and test set

Step 6: Model Fitting

Step 7: Predictions and Evaluations
